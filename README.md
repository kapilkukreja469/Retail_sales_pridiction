* Merging dataframes
* Handling Outliers and correcting the data types
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Hypothesis Testing between Categorical and Numerical variables
* Categorical Encoding
* Feature Manipulation
* Scaling the data using Standard Transform
* Splitting the data
* Training different models

At the end of colab notebook, we have also presented our Conclusion
